<!-- Task 1:
        > Write a JavaScript program using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
    Task 2:
        > Create a JavaScript program that uses a while loop to sum all even numbers
          between 1 and 20.
    Task 3:
        > Write a do-while loop that continues to ask the user for input until they enter a
          number greater than 10.
